<p>There are plenty of great <a href="http://www.android.com/phones-and-tablets/"></a>Android phones</a> out there, so it’s understandable if Google and its partners have managed to lure you away from that trusty iPhone, but getting settled into a new platform isn’t always easy. Luckily, some of your most basic wants are covered, including the transfer of contacts. Don’t waste your time and money getting a carrier store to do what ultimately amounts to a simple task</p>

<p>Transferring your existing address book from an iPhone to your new Android device is easily accomplished, and the majority of the process actually doesn’t even need to be completed from your smartphone. Here is how to <a href="http://www.androidphonesoft.com/resources/transfer-contacts-from-iphone-to-samsung-galaxy-s5.html"> transfer contacts from iphone to galaxy s5</a> using only a few basic tools.</p>

<p>Head to Settings on your iPhone and look for the “Mail, Contacts, Calendars” section of the menu. From here you’ll be able to add an account to your iPhone with the “Add Account” button. You will see Gmail in the list of providers that appears. Select Gmail and enter your Google account login information.</p>

<p>Once you have logged in, the next screen will ask you which parts of your Google account you’d like to sync. The second option in this list, Contact, will be toggled off. Tap this once and the toggle will flip and glow green. Once this happens, you iPhone and your Google account will begin sharing contacts.</p>
<p>You need to remain connected to the internet with your iPhone on during this process, but the phone won’t tell you when the contact sync has completed. If you have a lot of contacts, this could take a little while. The best way to keep an eye on this sync process is to head to your Google account with a web browser and check for yourself. Contacts.Google.com in your browser will take you right to the list of contacts.</p>

<h2><a name="rather-drive-stick" class="anchor" href="#rather-drive-stick"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Step 3: Start Google Sync</h2>
<p>When all of the contacts have been moved over, all you need to do next is log in to your Android device. Once you have logged in to that phone with your Google account, the contacts from your iPhone will sync to your Android phone and the process will be complete!</p>
